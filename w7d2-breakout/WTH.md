# WTH ?

- State is confusing =>
- Order of imports / How to import (Bottom to top, less mental strain)
- Functions given as props

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => ....}/>
{Button({onClick:() => {}})}

const someFunction = (callback) => {...}
const someFunction2 = ({props}) => {...}
```

State, Props, Components
